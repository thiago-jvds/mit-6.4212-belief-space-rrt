# Belief Space RRT in Drake
Robotic manipulation in uncertain environments requires reasoning about sensor noise and object pose uncertainty during motion planning. In this project, we develop a belief-space RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) motion planner for a Kuka iiwa manipulator that explicitly accounts for depth sensor uncertainty when grasping objects from a shelf. Gaussian noise is injected into RGB-D depth measurements to simulate realistic sensor behavior, and RANSAC-based plane fitting is used to estimate object pose with quantified uncertainty. Our belief-space planner propagates this uncertainty through the planning process, updating the robot's belief as new measurements are acquired. We compare this approach against a deterministic RRT planner that assumes perfect sensing. Evaluation metrics include task success rate, collision frequency, planning time, and trajectory safety margins under various levels of simulated noise. This work aims to demonstrate that explicitly modeling perception uncertainty enables more robust and reliable manipulation under realistic sensing conditions.
